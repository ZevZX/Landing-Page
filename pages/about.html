                <div class="about-text">
                    <p>Hi! I'm Zev, an amateur self-taught 19 year old programmer. I'm Mongolian but currently living in Germany. I dabble in HTML, CSS, JS, Python and GDScript.</p>
                    <h3>Hobbies and Interests</h3>
                    <p>I like playing video games, mostly Nintendo related stuff. I'm a huge fan of Sonic, Kirby and Dragon Ball. I used to play Super Smash Bros. Ultimate competitively but stopped about a year ago.
                        Looking forward to Smash 6, DRAGON BALL: Sparking! ZERO, Sonic X Shadow Generations and a new Mega Man game (if we're ever getting one).</p>
                    <h3>What does the 'ZX' mean?</h3>
                    <p>The ZX is just there to help differentiate me from other Zevs.
                    If you're wondering what the ZX stands for, they don't stand for anything.
                    I chose those letters because they simply sounded cool and because "Zev" was too short as a username for pretty much every website. 
                    Z is my favourite letter (not biased) and X is probably in my top 3.
                    Ok technically it comes the LEGO Ninjago Minifigures where each of the ninjas got new armors for marketing reasons midway through Season 1.
                    These armors were given the title "ZX" and it stands for "Zen eXtreme". These are by far my favourite looks for the ninja in the entire series and have stuck with me ever since my childhood.
                    But obviously the ZX on my username doesn't stand for that. Please don't ever refer to me as "ZevZX" just "Zev" is fine, many thanks.</p>
